            <h2>My name is Fariza and I love Programming & Web Development! </h2>
            <p>My path as "programming explorer" began in the 11th of school. I've learnt Python and had been participating
                in some Programming Olympiads of different levels: from local to international. And I knew I would be programmer
                so I've chosen Astana IT University with the major Software Engineering. Most of the time it's quite challenging, 
                but i believe that <em>Everything that kills me, makes me stronger!</em> <br>
                I started learning HTML/CSS/JS this summer, mostly because I became a teacher in SCP School for the 
                Introduction to Web Development. And now, when I have this course in my own study, my knowledge became very useful!

                <img src="./images-my-websites/drum-kit.png">
                <p>My very first published website, that i created to practice JavaScript by adding little animations
                        and sounds when buttons are pressed or clicked by mouse on the screen. This website is also
                        <em>responsive</em>, so it has different layout for phone users.

                <h4>"Inline/Block" Lesson</h4>
                <img src="./images-my-websites/lesson.png" class="float-right">
                <p>This is website I created for one of the lessons in our SCP school.
                        It's a school in our university that is created and leaded completely by AITU students-volunteers 
                        and supported by vice-rector for educational work. Our school is free because our students are children
                        from low-income families.
